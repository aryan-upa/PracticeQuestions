    How to get automated documentation of your code...
        The oracle docs are actually compiler created, the compiler takes the data from the
        javaDoc Description and then uses it according to the requirement.

        Go to Tools => Generate javaDoc => select components you want to Document,
        and there you go, you got your documentation.
